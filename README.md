Coding Challenge for Sesame Workshop

### Challenge 1 - Audio Recording
Although the challenge stated that the page should have only one button to record and autoplay the recording, but I felt that enabling the 'controls' attribute in the audio tag the audio controls gave the page a nice level of functionality, so I activated them. By activating them, a user can pause the audio during playback, or restart the audio and listen to it again.

### Challenge 2 - iframe
I'm not sure if the intention was to pull data from a cross-origin iframe to a parent window, but I wasn't sure how to do that so my iframe has the same origin as the page this challenge runs on. Outside of an iframe, I could have used a cross-orgin XMLHttp request, but I assumed (hopefully correctly), that the challenge expected the work to be done with an iframe.
